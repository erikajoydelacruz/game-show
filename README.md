# Game Show App (Treehouse Techdegree)

This is a guessing game. The user is given a hidden word, and a correct letter guess will reveal the letter while an incorrect guess will lose a heart. Win or lose, the player will be prompted to play again at the end of the game. 

There are several different components in this project â€“ a function to get a random phrase, a function to track the user's guesses, a function to keep track of the number of correct letters to show a win screen. This project was one of the funnest for me to make because it gave me insight on how simple games like this work. I've never made a game before and this one was perfect for my skill level at the time. I hope to make more games like this in the future.
